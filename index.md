# Open Source Autonomous Boat
## What is OSAB
OSAB is a student led project that is focused on fighting climate change through the use of STEM while inspiring young students. We are creating open source boats that will go on missions to collect data on the ocean and the atmosphere. They will travel for up to 6 mounths while only being powered by their solar panels although most missions will only be 1-3 months long.
